            <p>
                Ghana's real estate industry has undergone a strategic repositioning in recent years, positioning itself
                as one of the most promising investment destinations in sub-Saharan Africa. With a GDP growth rebound of
                3.2% in 2023 and a steady urban population expansion of over 4.1% annually, the demand for housing,
                commercial property, and mixed-use infrastructure continues to rise.

            <p>
                Accra, the capital, now boasts a residential property occupancy rate of 92% in prime areas, and real
                estate contributes approximately 11.1% to Ghana's non-oil GDP. The government's renewed emphasis on
                urban regeneration, affordable housing, and public-private partnerships has opened the sector to
                significant foreign participation.

                growth-driven market with solid fundamentals. Investors who act now can ride the wave of demographic
                growth, infrastructure improvements, and policy stability to secure above-average returns.
